# 🏦 Banking Automation with Agentic AI

![](banking-automation-banner.png)

## 🤔 The Problem
GFM Bank is facing significant operational challenges due to its reliance on traditional, manual banking processes. Customers often endure long wait times—20 to 30 minutes to speak with a teller, and up to 45 minutes more for back-office approvals. These delays are especially problematic during peak seasons and for complex requests, such as overdraft approvals or fee reversals. Additionally, services are only available during business hours, limiting accessibility and convenience. Staff are burdened with repetitive tasks, leading to inefficiencies and inconsistent customer experiences.
