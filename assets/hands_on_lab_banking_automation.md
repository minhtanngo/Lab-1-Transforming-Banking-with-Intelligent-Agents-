## 🔍 Introduction

Welcome to the GFM Bank Agentic AI Lab! In this hands-on workshop, you'll transform a traditional banking application into a modern, AI-powered solution using **watsonx Orchestrate**. The banking industry is undergoing rapid digital transformation, and GFM Bank is leading the way by implementing innovative AI agents to handle customer interactions.

GFM Bank faces challenges with traditional teller and back-office operations that are manual, time-consuming, and often result in long customer wait times. By implementing an Agentic AI solution, the bank aims to:

- Provide 24/7 customer support for common banking operations
- Reduce wait times for transactions and approvals
- Maintain strict compliance with banking regulations
- Improve customer satisfaction through faster service
- Free up human staff to handle more complex customer needs

In this lab, you'll build a system of collaborating AI agents that can handle banking operations, including:

- Account balance inquiries
- Money transfers between accounts
- Overdraft limit approvals
- Fee reversals
- Product information requests

## 📊 Banking Operations

*Currently, GFM Bank relies on human tellers for basic transactions and back-office staff for approvals, leading to delays and inconsistent customer experiences in peak season.*

### Current User Scenario
John, a GFM Bank customer, needs to make an urgent payment of €8,000, but he only has €5,000 in his account. 

1. John visits the bank branch and waits in line to speak with a teller
2. The teller checks his balance and informs him he has insufficient funds
3. John requests an overdraft of €3,000
4. The teller must escalate the request to a back-office manager
5. John waits again for approval
6. Once approved, he returns to the teller to complete the transfer
7. If John realizes he sent too much money, he needs to request a reversal, which requires another approval process

This process typically takes 1-2 hours of John's time and involves multiple staff members.

### Future with Agentic AI
With the AI-powered system you'll build today:

1. John messages the GFM Bank Orchestrator Agent
2. He requests to transfer €8,000
3. The Teller Agent checks his balance and informs him of insufficient funds
4. John requests an overdraft
5. The Teller Agent routes this request to the Back Office Agent
6. Upon approval (if the request is less than €10,000) from the Back Office Agent, the Teller Agent completes the transfer
7. If John needs a reversal, it's handled quickly within the same conversation

The entire process takes minutes instead of hours, and John never has to leave his home.
